## Description
The purpose of this board is to control a stepper motor via the RS232 or Asynchronous UART communication protocols using the SGS-THOMSON Interactive Stepper Motor Programming Language and Executor (S.I.M.P.L.E.). Additionally, this board provides various types of feedback, including information about the motor's current movement or acceleration status, confirmation of the motor's home position, and indication of the controller's readiness to execute instructions, among other functions.
